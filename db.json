Having showcased her work in fashion shows and exhibitions across the country, designer Shriya Bhupal in an exclusive chat with Pinkvilla, gave us some much-needed wedding outfit tips, about the latest trends and much more. Shriya also shared the inputs regarding the trousseau, and styles and silhouettes that are huge this season. Which are the colours that are raging super big this festive season? People, unfortunately, do not have the luxury of time off late, in this case, how can one put together a last-minute look? By mixing the styles and experimenting. Looking at a wardrobe full of clothes and yet having nothing to wear is a dilemma we all go through. The best scenario here would be to put together styles to create an entirely new outfit - saves you time + money. For someone who isn't purely desi, what should those guys opt for? The wedding season is just around the corner, so what are the hues that every bride must opt for? Destination weddings are the new in thing, so what should one carry to for the wedding without paying excess baggage? If you were attending your best friends wedding what would you wear for the haldi ceremony, sangeet and wedding? For the haldi, it would be a minimal ruffled lehenga in a pastel color because it's light & easy. For the Sangeet, my pick would be a heavily embellished lehenga topped with a fur cape. And for the wedding, I would pick a chiffon tie-up blouse and a floral embellished lehenga. It's modern, yet dramatic. One major no-no that a bride must never do on her big day? One trend which is way too passe? A matchy bride ie. lipstick being red outfit being red and red nails. It's way too overdone. Earlier this year, Shriya got married to Anindith Reddy in Hyderabad on July 6. The designer got married in a grand wedding in July attended by many renowned designers and celebrities from the film industry. Anindith is the eldest son of Vishweshwar Reddy, sitting MP of Chevella and one of the richest politicians in Telangana."

		"desc": "We have to just accept the fact that we will never stop gushing over Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor Khan's baby boy Taimur Ali Khan. Since the time he was born, he often becomes the topic of discussion all thanks to his cuteness and adorable eyes. A year after he was born, we got to see another cutie and that's Inaaya Naumi Kemmu. Both the cousins have been making people go aww over them and their photos, of course, go instantly viral on the Internet. Today, the paparazzi snapped both Taimur and Inaaya enjoying their playtime together. Taimur, who has become paparazzi's favourite was seen waving and talking to them while the photogs clicked him. Baby Tim looked cute as a button wearing a blue striped T-Shirt and blue denim shorts with a pair of blue sneakers. On the other hand, Inaaya was seen nestled in the arms of her nanny wearing a collared floral printed frock, white shoes and bow-style headband. Check out the adorable photos of Taimur and Inaaya below and tell us about it in the comments section. Recently, reports suggested that Saif Ali Khan and Kareena wanted to keep Taimur away from the shutterbugs for now. But, Saif dismissed the rumours stating that these speculations were false. Meanwhile, in an EXCLUSIVE interview with Pinkvilla, Saif spoke candidly to us about how Taimur has changed Saifeena's life. \"Our timings have changed. We've become more responsible. We sleep earlier. We wake up earlier because he is up at the crack of dawn. Your mental timetable is more based around him than around yourself. And that's a welcome change. I like a bit more stable routine and he is helping me do that. I'm very happy about it!,\" Saif gushed about Taimur."

		"desc": "The superstar behind the famous label Shriya Som, Shriya Bhupal is a prominent fashion industry. Having showcased her work in fashion shows and exhibitions across the country, designer Shriya Bhupal in an exclusive chat with Pinkvilla, gave us some much-needed wedding outfit tips, about the latest trends and much more. Shriya also shared the inputs regarding the trousseau, and styles and silhouettes that are huge this season. Which are the colours that are raging super big this festive season? People, unfortunately, do not have the luxury of time off late, in this case, how can one put together a last-minute look? By mixing the styles and experimenting. Looking at a wardrobe full of clothes and yet having nothing to wear is a dilemma we all go through. The best scenario here would be to put together styles to create an entirely new outfit - saves you time + money. For someone who isn't purely desi, what should those guys opt for? The wedding season is just around the corner, so what are the hues that every bride must opt for? Destination weddings are the new in thing, so what should one carry to for the wedding without paying excess baggage? If you were attending your best friends wedding what would you wear for the haldi ceremony, sangeet and wedding? For the haldi, it would be a minimal ruffled lehenga in a pastel color because it's light & easy. For the Sangeet, my pick would be a heavily embellished lehenga topped with a fur cape. And for the wedding, I would pick a chiffon tie-up blouse and a floral embellished lehenga. It's modern, yet dramatic. One major no-no that a bride must never do on her big day? One trend which is way too passe? A matchy bride ie. lipstick being red outfit being red and red nails. It's way too overdone. Earlier this year, Shriya got married to Anindith Reddy in Hyderabad on July 6. The designer got married in a grand wedding in July attended by many renowned designers and celebrities from the film industry. Anindith is the eldest son of Vishweshwar Reddy, sitting MP of Chevella and one of the richest politicians in Telangana."

		"desc": "We have to just accept the fact that we will never stop gushing over Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor Khan's baby boy Taimur Ali Khan. Since the time he was born, he often becomes the topic of discussion all thanks to his cuteness and adorable eyes. A year after he was born, we got to see another cutie and that's Inaaya Naumi Kemmu. Both the cousins have been making people go aww over them and their photos, of course, go instantly viral on the Internet. Today, the paparazzi snapped both Taimur and Inaaya enjoying their playtime together. Taimur, who has become paparazzi's favourite was seen waving and talking to them while the photogs clicked him. Baby Tim looked cute as a button wearing a blue striped T-Shirt and blue denim shorts with a pair of blue sneakers. On the other hand, Inaaya was seen nestled in the arms of her nanny wearing a collared floral printed frock, white shoes and bow-style headband. Check out the adorable photos of Taimur and Inaaya below and tell us about it in the comments section. Recently, reports suggested that Saif Ali Khan and Kareena wanted to keep Taimur away from the shutterbugs for now. But, Saif dismissed the rumours stating that these speculations were false. Meanwhile, in an EXCLUSIVE interview with Pinkvilla, Saif spoke candidly to us about how Taimur has changed Saifeena's life. \"Our timings have changed. We've become more responsible. We sleep earlier. We wake up earlier because he is up at the crack of dawn. Your mental timetable is more based around him than around yourself. And that's a welcome change. I like a bit more stable routine and he is helping me do that. I'm very happy about it!,\" Saif gushed about Taimur."
